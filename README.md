Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the development of many immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts.Treatment depends on the type of ALL, age at diagnosis, and other factors. In any case, early detection and diagnosis are key to a good change for a cure. In order to reach a decisive conclusion for the diagnosis of the disease and the degree of progression, it is of paramount importance to identify malignant cells with high accuracy. The task of distinguishing lymphoblasts from normal white blood cells under the microscope is however generally challenging, as morphologically the images of the two cell types appear similar. The process of identifying malignant cells and in helping pathologist and oncologist make quicker and data-driven inferences.
